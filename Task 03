Vehicle using STM32 micro-controller”,
"description" : "The task of the UAV is to operate normally and
execute its basic functions. I t is necessary to have a group of devices acting together in
an independent and integrated manner. Commercially available flight controllers do
not allow customization. Hence there is a need to create a open hardware architecture
to change the characteristics of the controller according to the user requirements . The
aim of the project is to create a flight controller using STM32 micro-controller for
autonomous operations. It uses PID control algorithm that acts as a control loop
feedback mechanism."
