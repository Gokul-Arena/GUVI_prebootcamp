execute its basic functions. I t is necessary to have a group of devices acting together in
an independent and integrated manner. Commercially available flight controllers do
not allow customization. Hence there is a need to create a open hardware architecture
to change the characteristics of the controller according to the user requirements . The
aim of the project is to create a flight controller using STM32 micro-controller for
autonomous operations. It uses PID control algorithm that acts as a control loop
feedback mechanism."

var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

var flag=true;

if(Object.keys(obj1).length==Object.keys(obj2).length){
    for(key in obj1) { 
        if(obj1[key] == obj2[key]) {

*** Task 1: Simple Programs todo for variables ***

1. Declare four variables without assigning values and print them in console.

Code:
let a, b, c, d;
console.log(a,b,c,d);

Output:
undefined undefined undefined undefined



2. How to get value of the variable myvar as output.

Code:
var myvar = 1;
console.log(myvar);

Output:
1



3. Declare variables to store your first name, last name, marital status, country and age in multiple lines.

Code:
let firstName;
let lastName;
let maritalStatus;
let country;
let age;



4. Declare variables to store your first name, last name, marital status, country and age in a single line.

Code:
let firstName, lastName, maritalStatus, country, age;



5. Declare variables and assign string, boolean, undefined and null data types.

Code:
let str = "GUVI"; //string
let bool = true; //boolean
let undef = undefined; //undefined
let nul = null; //null



6. Convert the string to integer.

Code:
let a = "Zen"; //string

let b = parseInt(a);
let c = Number(a);
let d = +(a);

console.log(typeof(a), typeof(b), typeof(c), typeof(d));

Output:
string number number number



7. Write 6 statement which provide truthy & falsey values.

Code:
let a, b, c, d, e, f;

a = (1 == true); // true
b = (0 === true); //false
c = (null == undefined); //true
d = (null === undefined); // false
e = (true == true); //true
f = (true == false); //false

console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f);

Output:
true false true false true false



*** Task 2: Simple Programs todo for Operators ***

1. Square of a number.

Code:
let a = 9;
let b = a*a;
console.log(b);

Output:
81
